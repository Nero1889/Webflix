Webflix is a modern movie API-based website that prioritizes UI/UX design, speed, efficency and responsiveness. Initially starting from scratch on Figma, the project very quickly grew in scope as the idea became realized. Webflix is able to fetch data for movies, shows and actors all with ease via the built in dynamic search bar with suggestions to based on your query.

There are pages for API-info that include: movie / show name, runtime, release date, rating, description, watch trailer button, genres section, cast members and similar movies. The page for actors includes: name, role, biography 3 pictures age, place and date of birth, as well as filmography for shows and movies they starred in. 

And on top of ALL this... Webflix was built mobile first, and all movies, sugguestions, cast members and so SO much more that doesn't render properly, ALL have back-up and fall-back elements ready to go! And yes, this also applies to error handling. Webflix above everything, embodies attention to detail!
